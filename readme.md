#The Magic of Markdown

This is a simple tutorial on how to use markdown in three different contexts:

- R for reproducible analysis (as RMarkdown)
- GitHub Pages (As GitHub Markdown)
- Using Pandoc to Transform markdown into other formats.

The main slides are in `output/magic-of-markdown.html`. There is also an RMarkdown example available as `Rmarkdown-example.Rmd` which you can open up in Rstudio.
